* CRC or you can't add wValue(...)
  - w(...) must return inherrited class

* Is A::Type() Function or class?
  - If class, then constructors have to be written
    - Zero values ctor for calling must exist
    - Either:
      - Initialization is done an extra time when copying or...
      - copy constructor is needed or initialization is done with
        _every_ .w(...) just to be immediately discarded.
      - Rule of five....
  - If function, then
    - Rule of zero class
    - Still CRC.
